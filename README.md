# MULTPLE DISEASE PREDICTION USING ML

Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is the system that is used to predict the diseases from the symptoms which are given by the patients or any user. The system processes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the output as the probability of the disease.A feature selection-based machine learning algorithm is proposed to predict three chronic diseases, namely, diabetes, heart attack, and Parkinson's. There is a need to study and make a system which will make it easy for an end users to predict the chronic diseases without visiting physician or doctor for diagnosis. To detect the Various Diseases through the examining Symptoms of patient's using different techniques of Machine Learning Models.
### SKILLS:
1.Python

2.Pandas

3.Streamlit

4.MAchine Learning
## Workflow
step1:Get the data from kaggle and import the neccessary libraries

step2:Read the data and check the null values and duplicate vealues to remove

step3:Feature selection to select the feature values and target to remove the unncecessary variables

step4:Train Test selection and check the model accuracy in train and test data

step5:Select the ML alogrithms to use the data which the tagert variable in siutable.

step5:Dump the model in the picke file and using a streamlit to delpoy the model

step6: Deployed the Model.


## Uses: 
The system processes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the output as the probability of the disease.
